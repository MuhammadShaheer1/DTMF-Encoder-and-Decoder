# DTMF-Encoder-and-Decoder

DTMF (Dual Tone Multiple Frequency) Encoder and Decoder informally named as Touch Tone 
allocates a unique tone to each button on an appliance (made up of two frequencies high and low). 
The DTMF Dialing system traces its roots to a technique AT & amp T developed in the 1950s 
known as MF (Multiple Frequency) which was developed within the AT & ampT telephone network 
to direct call between switching facilities using in-band signaling.


The DTMF system uses eight different frequency signals transmitted in pairs to represent sixteen 
different numbers, symbols and letters.

Whenever a key is pressed on the Touch Tone, sinusoidal signal is generated containing the sum of 
two frequencies. These frequencies are chosen by design engineers because the sum or difference of 
any of the two frequencies gives a unique frequency which is not equal to any of the given 
frequency. With the help of this, dialed signal can easily be detected. The uniqueness of DTMF is 
that it is simple to generate and noiseimmune.
